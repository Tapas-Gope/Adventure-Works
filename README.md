## Introduction

The AdventureWorks Sales Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the company's sales performance from 2019 to 2024. It tracks key metrics such as total sales, budget vs. sales performance, and top customers and products. The dashboard helps stakeholders understand sales trends across different time periods, product categories, and regions, enabling data-driven decisions that improve sales strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.

The data is presented through interactive visuals, allowing users to explore the performance by product, region, and customer segments.



### Steps followed 

- Step 1: Loaded data into Power BI Desktop from MS SQL Server database.
- Step 2: In the Power Query editor, used data profiling options to check column distribution, quality, and profile across the entire dataset.
- Step 3: Cleaned data by addressing missing values and ensuring all relevant columns were accurate.
- Step 4: Created various visuals, including bar charts, line charts, and card visuals to represent key metrics such as total sales, sum of budget, sales by product category, etc.
- Step 5: Applied slicers for month and years to allow dynamic filtering of the visuals.
- Step 6: Created measures to calculate budget amount, sales and sales/budget amount using DAX expressions.
- Step 7: Designed the dashboard layout and applied visual filters to allow the end-user to drill down into specific sales data. 


## Data Cleaning Process Using SQL
Before importing the data into Power BI, I used SQL queries to clean and prepare the data. The SQL data cleaning process involved:
### Removing Duplicates
- I ran queries to check for and remove any duplicate records in the tables to ensure data accuracy.
### Handling Missing Values
- Queries were used to identify missing or null values in critical columns such as SalesAmount and CustomerKey. Where appropriate, missing values were replaced or excluded to avoid skewing the data.

### Correcting Data Types
- Ensured that all numeric fields (e.g., SalesAmount, OrderQuantity) were of the correct data type to prevent errors during analysis.
### Filtering Data
- The dataset was filtered to include only records from 2019 to 2024, which was necessary to align the analysis period with the scope of the dashboard.
